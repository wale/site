## Study, study, study
I've mainly been working on completing my [Bachelor's degree](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/course/bachelor-of-information-and-communication-technology/). Despite my rather unconventional path to tertiary studies, I'm going well. Not a big fan of networking though.

## Ideas and data science
A lot of my ideas as of late have consisted of visualisation of varying pieces of data, to the point where I am working on an [open source data vis project](https://mapping.melbourne). I hope that I finally have something to show sometime this year.

## Photography
I've also recently taken up more forms of photography, such as taking photos of landmarks, as well as adding to my cityscape photos. I am also working on a gallery to finally compile some of the photographs I have taken over the past few years. Some examples follow.

## Music
A lot of my recent music listens are mainly in languages that I don't really speak. 

I've been vibing with [Suavemente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLfqapBIqME) by Soolking, as well as [90x180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuiKiNeHXZQ) by Eno. I have also been to listening to long-standing favourite artists, such as Venetian Snares' [My Half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f83NxRZ4lRI), and [Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHIS-1ckNcY) by RiverKinn and Joei Razook.
