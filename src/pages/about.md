I'm Duale Siad, pronounced like "doo-AR-lee SEE-ad" /duɐːliː siːæd/, otherwise known on the internet as "Wale" /wɐːliː/. I'm a Java programmer, occasional blogger, and hobbyist photographer.

I mainly dabble in open source work using the programming languages **Kotlin** and **Java**, as well as **TypeScript**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

I am currently a student at [Swinburne University](https://swinburne.edu.au), where I commence the [BA-ICT](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-information-and-communication-technology/) course in 2023.

## For Employers & Recruiters
I no longer have a public résumé/curriculum vitae, nor do I have a LinkedIn account. If you are a prospective recruiter or an employer, please email me at <a href='&#109;a&#105;lt&#111;&#58;enq&#43;r%65%63&#37;&#55;2%75itm%&#54;5nt&#64;wa&#37;6&#67;e%2&#69;a%75'>enq+recru&#105;&#116;m&#101;n&#116;&#64;wale&#46;au</a> for a copy.
