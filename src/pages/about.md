I'm Duale Siad, pronounced like "doo-AR-lee SEE-ad" /duɐːliː siːæd/, otherwise known on the internet as "Wale" /wɐːliː/. I'm a Java programmer, occasional blogger, and hobbyist photographer.

I mainly dabble in open source work using the programming languages **Kotlin** and **Java**, as well as **TypeScript**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

I'm currently a student at [RMIT University](https://rmit.edu.au) that studies the [Diploma of Information Technology](https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/vocational-study/diplomas/diploma-of-information-technology-c5402) course.
