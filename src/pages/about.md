I'm Duale Siad, pronounced like "doo-AR-lee SEE-ad" /duɐːliː siːæd/, otherwise known on the internet as "Wale" /wɐːliː/. I'm a Java programmer, occasional blogger, and hobbyist photographer.

I mainly dabble in open source work using the programming languages **Kotlin** and **Java**, as well as **TypeScript**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

I am currently a student at [Swinburne University](https://swinburne.edu.au), where I commence the [BA-ICT](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-information-and-communication-technology/) course in 2023.
