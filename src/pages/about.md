## Overview

I'm Duale Siad, pronounced like "doo-AR-lee SEE-ad" /duɐːliː siːæd/, otherwise known on the internet as "Wale" /wɐːliː/. I'm a Java programmer, occasional blogger and writer, and hobbyist photographer.

I mainly dabble in open source work using the programming languages **Kotlin** and **Java**, as well as **TypeScript**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

I am currently a student at [Swinburne University](https://swinburne.edu.au), where I commence the [Bachelor's Degree in Information, Communication and Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-information-and-communication-technology/) course in 2023.

Important information about me will be signed using a cryptographic key, which has not been announced on this page as of yet.

## Contact
I'm easily reachable by any of the following:
- [Enquiries] Email: **[enq@wale.au](mailto:enq@wale.au)**
- My [Mastodon account](https://merveilles.town/@wale)

## Some interesting facts
- Nearly all of my programming knowledge as of yet, has been fully self-taught, except for a select few bits and pieces.
- I've been taking photographs as a hobby for many years, though I haven't owned a proper camera (such as a [digital single-lens reflex camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera)) until recently, instead experimenting with mobile photography.
