## Experience
### Open Source Developer - Self-employed
#### 2017 - present, Melbourne, AU
My open-source work has been chiefly written in Kotlin and Java, though I had utilised Python and languages that used the Node.js runtime; such as JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Maintain [Gradle](https://gradle.org) plugins, such as [gradle-tailwind](https://github.com/wale/gradle-tailwind).
- Improve problem-solving and interpersonal skills by using a platform that allows for collaborative work.

### System Administrator - Self-employed
#### 2021-03 - 2023-08, Melbourne, AU
I had operated one of the available Linux repository mirrors in Australia, for the Linux distribution [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and the Android terminal emulator [Termux](https://termux.dev). Though the work on the repository mirrors were initially maintaining Bash scripts, I learned valuable skills in managing repositories using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), as well as strengthening my workflow with Alpine Linux.
